# KiCad Panel Assembly Files Generator Tool
This tool can be used to combine and generate new BOM files and placement files for panelized PCBs created in KiCad. The tool can take multiple BOMs for different designs together with multiple placement files linked to each individual BOM and then generates new reference designators for all parts, such that each part from the placement files can be linked directly to a item in the BOM. The user can then generate new BOM and placement files with the altered reference designators to be able to upload the design onto JLCPCB for assembly without any further effort.
